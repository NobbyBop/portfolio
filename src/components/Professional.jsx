		    At Noom, I am developing a company-wide agent platform. I'm working on improving agent-centered development with loops and self learning. So far, I've been exposed to a lot of new technologies such as AWS Agentcore, advanced GitHub workflows, and IaC. I'm adopting an agent-first style of building and am excited to keep learning!

                In this role, I built AI agents for both external and internal use. 
                Externally, I developed agents for training documentation purposes. 
                Internally, I created an agent that integrated with Smartlead to receive, 
                categorize, store, and reply to customer emails. I worked with multiple 
                frameworks including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Vercel. A particularly interesting 
                project I made was a "hiring manager agent" that conducted simulated conversations with 
                applicant agents and evaluated their performance. You can view more about that {" "}

                As a course assistant I held several responsibilities, including teaching a lab section,
                holding office hours, and proctoring/grading exams and assignments. These required me to
                have expertise in topics such as ARM Assembly, C, Linux, Bash, and more. (I actually built
                an AI agent to make my life a little easier. It searches through the textbook, looks at course
                logistics, and more. You can view that {" "}

            <p> My main deliverable in this role was a fully automatic training schedule system, 
                for contracted construction workers, electricians, plumbers, and others. Interestingly enough,
                I "programmed" the entire system in Smartsheet (if you're unfamiliar, it's similar to Excel).
                Coming from a programming background, I initially found the limitations of the software
                frustrating. But, it forced me to get creative. I was able to leverage complicated formulas
                and data flows to take users through the entire process of scheduling and tracking their required
                OSHA training, as well as providing a helpful interface for administrators.
