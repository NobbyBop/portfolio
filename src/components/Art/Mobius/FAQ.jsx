        <h3>Who is MOBIUS LINE?</h3>
        <p>
          MOBIUS LINE is Bennet Stoll, Grayson Beck, Jon Burke, Jack Kline, (and
          Captain). <br />
          <br />
          There's lead singer, Bennet Stoll. He's a little too full of himself
          to be anything but. Grayson Beck is responsible for coming up with
          some of our song's most iconic lines, and also for shredding that
          guitar like an absolute <i>madman</i>! The one behind the keys is Jon
          Burke. If a show ever starts late, it's Jon's fault. Jack Kline is our
          bassist and ALSO runs the business side of things. Probably our most
          important member is Captain, our cat. (He only thinks he's in charge).

        <h3>Why are you called MOBIUS LINE?</h3>
        <p>
          Grayson's girlfriend of 7 years was a huge advocate for him to
          actually pursue his dreams of making music and a name for himself. We
          probably wouldn't be here without her pushing him. We wanted to honor
          her for being the spark that ignited the flame, so we put her last
          name, Line, in the name of the band. As far as Mobius? We just thought
          that had a cool ring to it and was a little paradoxical.

        <h3>Where is MOBIUS LINE located?</h3>
        <p>
          Trying to be as general as possible in fear of accidentally doxing
          ourselves, MOBIUS LINE and all of its band members are located in the
          general New York area. If you ever bump into us in the wild, feel free
          to say hi! We love meeting all of you guys and have already had
          several lovely encounters with a couple of you.
        </p>

      <div className="faqentry">
        <h3>Do you sell any merch?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes! We love translating our song ideas into cool apparel for you
          guys! All of our merch can be appropriately found under the 'Merch'
          tab. Items sell out fast, but we try to keep up. Our stickers are
          especially popular, so keep a close eye on them!
        </p>

      <div className="faqentry">
        <h3>How do you come up with your songs?</h3>
        <p>
          We come up with our music in all sorts of different ways! We always
          keep a notebook on hand with us with a massive list of song topics we
          want to cover eventually. We also like to listen for peculiar and
          unique sounds that we could incorporate into our songs. From there we
          mix and match the sounds and melodies to the topics that fit the vibe.

        <h3>Are you currently going on tour?</h3>
        <p>
          We currently aren't touring any cities right now. Getting to go on
          tour for our first album was such a surreal and unbelievable
          experience so we'll definitely go on tour again once we have enough
          new material to play for you guys! If you're curious about any past
          tours, photos from each location can be found on our 'Tour' tab, which
          is also where you'll be able to secure your tickets once we do go on
          tour again!
        </p>

      <div className="faqentry">
        <h3>How expensive are tickets?</h3>
        <p>
          We're currently not on tour right now, but ticket prices for the last
          tour would vary in price depending on the venue. We try to keep them
          as cheap as possible for you guys but paying for the venue can be
          expensive. Expect ticket prices to range anywhere from 30$-75$ for
          when we do go on tour again.
        </p>

      <div className="faqentry">
        <h3>How often do you release new music?</h3>
        <p>
          We release songs as they come out and can't commit to any consistent
          schedule. When we first started MOBIUS LINE we were able to release a
          song about every 3 months, but both going on tour and creating a merch
          line has significantly slowed things down. Once we learn how to juggle
          both the business and creative side of things, we'll be able to
          release songs more frequently. We are also currently working on a new
          song that's guaranteed to knock your socks off but is taking longer
          than your average song. Stay posted for that ;)

        <h3>Does Captain go on tour?</h3>
        <p>
          Does a ship sail, plane fly, or rocket launch without its captain? Of
          course not. We need Captain with us in order to guide us on our
          voyage. Captain is quite used to loud sounds being around our music so
          much, so while you may not see Captain appear on stage, rest assured,
          he is always with us.

        <h3>Have you collaborated with other artists?</h3>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, we have yet to collaborate with anyone else as of the
          time of writing this. We're super open to the idea of mixing our
          creative energy with someone else's, but we're still relatively new
          and just haven't gotten the chance to do so yet.
