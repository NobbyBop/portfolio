        We're so happy to announce that after such a successful show in , we
        caught the attention of Indie Insight! They wanted us to be one of the
        bands they interview, and of course, Bennet couldn't resist the
        attention, so you can check that out{" "}
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Indie_Insights_Indie">here</a>! We're
        so honored that you guys support us and our songs so much that
        journalists are actively reaching out hoping to hear what our favorite
        color of jelly bean is (It's red). It's such an incredible amount of
        support and we are all so so grateful to each and every one of you for
        making our dreams into a reality. Sadly, Bennet was the only one who was
        actually able to make it since the rest of us all had prior commitments,
        but don't worry, this won't be the last time we go on someone's show to
        talk about all the cool stuff we've been cooking up! But in the
        meantime, enjoy listening to Bennet! He legitimately did a great job,
        and there isn't a question in there that he answered that we would have
        answered any differently. So what are you waiting for? Go give it a
        listen! GOGOGOGOGOGOGO

      <h3 className="newstitle">We have merch!!!</h3>
      <h4 className="newsdate">2024-10-25</h4>
      <p className="newsletter">
        After receiving so many requests from you guys for us to create our own
        set of merch drops, we've finally done it! We're so flattered (and a
        little confused) that you guys enjoy our music so much that you'd want
        to wear it on a t-shirt, but enough of you wanted it, and who are we to
        deny your requests? The merch will be available in about 5 weeks, but
        pre-orders will go live later today. Unfortunately, this is a bit of a
        test run with the merch company that we're working with so we'll only be
        able to fulfill orders in the US and Canada. But if enough of you guys
        are interested in this and show the merch company that we're a valuable
        partner, then for round two we'll be able to expand worldwide! We're
        offering 3 different apparel options each with 4 options for designs,
        and then a sticker pack with all 4 designs. Our designs include Banana
        Peel Skeleton, Eye Patch Cat, The Grayson Bennet Rivalry, and of course
        our logo with the text OOS (Only One Side) under it. These designs can
        be on either t-shirts, hoodies, or bucket hats. We're really proud of
        how these designs turned out and we hope you guys enjoy wearing them as
        much as we enjoyed making them! We've added a new 'Merch' tab to our
        website where all of these cool goodies will be located. Enjoy!

      <h3 className="newstitle">Who are you people???</h3>

        Well hello, everyone! Wow. What happened? One moment we're just creating
        silly little songs for fun with an average of 10 streams a month, and
        the next, we have nearly 10000X that amount! We're really thankful to
        Stevens Institute of Technology for allowing us to play at their school
        because that seems to be how so many of you found us. To all of you who
        are new, welcome! We're Mobius Line, an indie rock band looking to share
        our songs with the world. We're relatively new, so we don't have that
        deep of a library yet, but we're proud of what we do have and are
        working hard to get more songs straight to your headphones. We've had
        this idea for a song in the back of our heads for a while now, but it
        was always something that we thought would be more effort than it's
        worth, but after this new surge of listeners, we feel extra compelled to
        prove to you guys that you guys aren't making a mistake supporting us.
        We've started working on this new song that'll be unlike anything you've
        heard before. We're putting in so much time and effort into this project
        and we're super passionate about making it! It will take a while,
        though, so we ask for your patience while we try to deliver the best
        product possible to you guys. In the meantime, we've added an 'FAQ' page
        to our site to help answer the many questions you guys seem to have
        about this mysterious band that blew up out of nowhere. We'll try to
        update it with new questions as often as possible. We'll also try to do
        these newsletters more regularly to keep you guys in the loop of any
        major events that are happening! Thank you again for all the sudden
        support and we hope we can make you guys proud!
