        <h2>PART SEVEN: THE LETTER</h2>
        <p>
          THE FINAL ITEM IN THE ENVELOPE IS A LETTER WHICH READS AS FOLLOWS:
        </p>
        <p>"DEAR MARSHALL,</p>
        <p>
          SORRY FOR MY DELAYED REPLY TO YOUR MOST RECENT LETTER, I HAVE BEEN
          VERY BUSY WITH PLANNING AND ORGANIZING THIS NEXT BATCH OF
          PRESENTATIONS. WE'VE MADE A LOT OF IMPROVEMENTS & IT IS LOOKING LIKE
          THIS SERIES WILL BE OUR MOST EFFECTIVE YET.
        </p>
        <p>
          IN YOUR LAST LETTER YOU ASKED WHY I AM INSTRUCTING PROCTORS TO BURN
          THE RESULTS. WHILE THIS MIGHT NOT BE THE MOST SATISFYING ANSWER, THE
          REASON IS SIMPLY THAT I AM NOT INTERESTED IN THE RESULTS. I ONLY WISH
          TO KNOW THAT THE PRESENTATIONS HAVE BEEN GIVEN, THAT THE PARTICIPANTS
          ARE COMPLETELY FOCUSED ON MY WORK FOR SOME SHORT TIME.
        </p>
        <p>
          I HOPE YOU ARE WELL. GIVE MY BEST TO YOUR FAMILY. SORRY FOR MY BREVITY
          BUT I MUST GET BACK TO WORK.
        </p>
        <p>YOURS TRULY, [LAMBDA]"</p>
        <img

        />
        <h2>DISMISSAL</h2>
        <p>
          AT THIS TIME WE HAVE REACHED THE END OF THE DIGITAL DISPLAY. AT THIS
          TIME THE CREATOR WISHES TO SPEAK A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE PROJECT. THEY
          ARE AS FOLLOWS:
        </p>
        <p>
          "WHEN MAKING "ATTENTION!" I WANTED TO CREATE A MYSTERY THAT
          PARTICIPANTS WOULD HAVE TO SOLVE. BY GIVING THEM THIS ENVELOPE, I GAVE
          THEM ALL EVIDENCE OF A PRESENTATION ("ATTENTION!") THAT HAD OCCURRED
          AND BEEN INTERCEPTED SOMEHOW. I WANTED THE PARTICIPANTS TO PIECE
          TOGETHER EACH PART OF THE PRESENTATION. HOW THE PROCTOR WOULD HAVE
          READ FROM THE BOOK, PLAYED THE CASSETTE, ADVANCED THROUGH THE SLIDES,
          AND COLLECTED PARTICIPANT RESULTS. I WANTED THEM TO ASK WHY THIS
          PRESENTATION HAD BEEN GIVEN, ONLY TO FIND THAT THE CREATOR HAD NO GOAL
          OTHER THAN TO TAKE THE ATTENTION OF THE VIEWER.
        </p>
        <p>
          THIS IDEA WAS INSPIRED BY THE THOUGHT THAT, AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT, A
          PERSON'S WHOLE UNIVERSE IS ONLY WHAT THEY HAVE THEIR ATTENTION ON, AND
          TO BE ABLE TO COMMAND SOMEONE'S ATTENTION, EVEN JUST FOR ONE SECOND,
          IS TO FULLY TAKE UP THEIR ENTIRE UNIVERSE FOR THAT TIME.
        </p>
        <p>
          I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS MY MOST AMBITIOUS PROJECT TO DATE, AND AM VERY
          PLEASEED WITH THE RESULTS, AESTHETICALLY AND CONTENT-WISE."
        </p>
        <p>AT THIS TIME YOU ARE DISMISSED.</p>
