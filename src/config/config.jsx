      MOBIUS LINE is an ARG (Augmented Reality Game) that I co-created with
      Sumner Badzik. This project involved creating branding and marketing for
      our fictitious band MOBIUS LINE, as well as constructing a narrative which
      is scattered across multiple social media platforms and accounts.
      Originally, posters (seen below) were hung around the neighborbood,
      linking to the start of the game. On this page I have included some of the
      graphic design work I did for the project, as well as some of our band
      photos, taken by <a

      explore the game{" "}
